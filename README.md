# markov-text-simulator

Originally used The Count of Monte Cristo as my simulated text, thus giving this project a tentative name of The Count of Monte Cristo Markov Chain Monte Carlo (TCoMCMCMC for short)

Reads in text of choosing (and can simulate text by 1 letter, 2 letter, or full word states)
